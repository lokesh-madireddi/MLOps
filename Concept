Machine Learning ops
----------------------------------

1. Machine Learning is a process of training a computer or machine with huge amount of data so that it identify the patten and predict the output. 
2. Data scientist identifies an algorithm and trains it with data set. 
3. During the training it will identify the pattern and it start developing mathematical function which we called as model.
4. Model (mathematical function) is a output of a machine learning process.

Steps How Data scientist create a Model: 
1. Start with a data set.
2. split (80%, 20% concept) --> 80% is used to train the algorithm and 20% to test the model. 
3. Algorithm --> (Logistic regression, Decission tree, K nearest Neighbour)
4. Train the model.  Now it will develop a mathematical function by it self and create a model.
5. Testing - 
6. Retraining if the result is not accurate.
7. Save it in .pkl, .joblib, .onnx format.
8. API creation --> ML engg will package the model into software applications to deploy.
